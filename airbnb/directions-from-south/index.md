­Keep following signs for 395 N into the city. Once you cross the Potomac, the road will curve to the right. Keep
following signs for 395N. ![](/public/1.jpg) 

------

This will lead you into the first of two tunnels. Keep following the signs for 395. ![](/public/2.jpg)

------

­Stay on the right side as you come out ![](/public/3.jpg)

------

From here you will follow signs for New York Avenue ![](/public/4.jpg)

------

This will lead into the second tunnel ![](/public/5.jpg)

------

Stay in the middle­-to-­left of the road. As you emerge into daylight, you will see the road split. You want to be on the left­hand side, 95/Baltimore: ![](/public/6.jpg)

------

Keep following signs for NY Ave. As you turn onto New York Avenue, get into the right lane. ![](/public/7.jpg)

------

You will make a right onto M street in just a block or two (the road branching off to the right in this next photo): ![](/public/8.jpg)

------

Follow M Street a couple of blocks to this intersection. Turn left onto North Capitol: ![](/public/9.jpg)

------

Follow North Capitol for a few blocks. By the time you see an Exxon station on your right, you will want to be in the right lane. The road at the Exxon intersection is Florida; you want to cross it. But Q Street is immediately after Florida ­­ it is between the red­-roofed pizza business and the brown rowhouse in this next photo. Make a right onto Q. That's our block--we're about 3/4 of the way down on the left. ![the house](/public/house.jpg)
