# Hi, neighbors!

## What is this about?

The Eckington Civic Association is preparing to vote on whether to apply for historic designation. We think they're likely to vote yes. We also think **historic designation will be bad for Eckington and D.C. as a whole**. If you agree, we hope you'll join us in voting against the application.

Add your email using the form at the bottom of this page and we'll send you updates as the process moves along.

## What does historic designation mean?

If Eckington becomes a historic district, when you make changes or repairs to your home -- like switching doors or windows, or building a deck -- you will need to get the approval of a historic review board composed of some of your neighbors, as well as the city's office of historic preservation. They have the power to deny plans that aren't consistent with the chosen historic period, both in terms of appearance and materials. This is on top of the zoning and permitting restrictions you already need to go through with DCRA. If your home is not historically compliant and doesn't have a spotless permitting trail, you could even be prevented from restoring it to the condition in which you bought it.


## What's good about historic designation?

Historic designation can preserve the current look of neighborhoods. By reducing the supply of housing, it also tends to drive up home prices, so it can be financially beneficial for people who already own homes (though this is arguably offset by the downsides like slower growth of businesses serving the community).


## What's bad about historic designation?

The people proposing these limits mean well. But historic designation rules add complexity and time to projects, and make some types of housing illegal. This has bad consequences:

- Home prices and rents are likely to increase
- Low-income residents may not be able to afford repairs
- More hassle and less freedom when planning renovations
- Fewer people will be able to live in Eckington

It's this last one that really bugs me. Eckington is a beautiful neighborhood that's in a great location, and more people would probably like to become our neighbors. More neighbors mean more businesses serving Eckington, safer streets and better schools.

Speaking more broadly, there's a housing crisis across American cities -- we have not been building new homes as quickly as we need to, and limits on housing play a big part. San Francisco has strangled itself with these kinds of limits, and is now only affordable for the very rich. D.C. is already too expensive! We shouldn't make the problem worse.

On an individual basis, each neighborhood tends to try to forbid change -- people who already own homes decide they like what they've got, and that new people and places should go somewhere else. But when every neighborhood in a city does this, the results are disastrous. We don't think it's ethical to vote for a measure like that.


## How will the process work?

- The Eckington Civic Association (ECA) is surveying the neighborhood about historic designation. They have said they will mail the survey and make it available online.

- On June 6 the ECA will vote on whether to pursue historic designation. Since the ECA has spent money to hire consultants to assist with the process, and since the meetings they have held on the subject have been uniformly pro-historic-designation, it is likely that the ECA's current membership will vote yes.

- Once they do, the measure will be voted on by the ANC. Since the measure will slow development, we expect the ANC to vote yes.

- Then the city's historic office will have to approve the application. This is likely since each new historic district expands the scope of that office's power.


## How can I get involved?

- Respond to the ECA survey. If you send us your email using the form below, we'll email you when the survey is available online so you don't miss it.

- Come to the June 6 meeting at the [Summit at St. Martin's](https://eckingtoncivicassociation.org/meetings-agendas/) (ironically, a building that would never have been built under historic district rules). You must be an ECA member to vote at their meetings. It costs $10 to join, and [you can do so online](https://eckingtoncivicassociation.org/contact-us/). If you enter your email in the form below, we'll email you a reminder about the meeting. If the $10 joining fee would be a hardship, please email us to let us know.


## Who are you?

We're Steph & Tom, your neighbors. We live at 50 Q NE, #2. I (Tom) write software for a mapping company on 14th Street and Steph is a lawyer. We moved to Eckington two years ago. Before that I spent a decade renting on O Street in Shaw. I used to write for DCist, and we both care about local government and housing issues. If you'd like to contact me, my address is thomas.j.lee@gmail.com.


## Did a shady developer pay for you to send these postcards?!

No, we don't have any connections to developers and we sent these postcards ourselves using a service called [Vistaprint](http://vistaprint.com). We just think historic designation would be bad for the neighborhood. And we think it's kind of annoying that other people can vote themselves control over our house ðŸ˜•. I have to admit: we live in a duplex pop-up. We didn't build it, but we love it and think that giving people homes is more important than making sure the streetscape conforms to some people's individual tastes.

We didn't send postcard to everyone because it would have been really expensive (D.C.'s [open address data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/aa514416aaf74fdc94748f1e56e7cc8a_0) lists over 1900 homes in Eckington, not counting subunits!). So if you care about this, please talk to your neighbors about it.


## Sign up for updates & reminders

We will never use your email for anything except news on the historic designation process. Once the process is finished, we'll delete those records.
